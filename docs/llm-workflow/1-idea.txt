Adulting.DIY: Keep up with your home, your dog, and your life.  Get email reminders of what's coming up that needs done. This is something my wife and I really need in our lives.  My previous employer (a facilities management company) offered me a version of this service but I lost access to it when I left the company.  Features at a minimum:

Task workflow - create, assign, respond, execute, delete
Task sharing - all household members see the tasks that need to be completed
Task categories - house, dog, auto, etc
Notifications and reminders - get alerted via email when someone creates, assigns, responds, executes, or deletes a task
Notification when a task is approaching, due date is reached, task is overdue
One time tasks that don't repeat
Recurring tasks that repeat over time
Repeat on the same day of the week, month, 2nd friday, etc (fixed schedule repeating)
Variable repeating, 2 weeks after last execution
This app will also be multi-household, meaning data will need to be segmented.
