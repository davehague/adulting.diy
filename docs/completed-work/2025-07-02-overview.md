  ðŸŽ¯ Summary of What I've Accomplished

  I've successfully implemented the highest priority missing functionality from your Adulting.DIY application:

  1. Complete Occurrence Scheduling System âœ…

  - All 6 recurrence pattern types fully implemented
  - 3-month horizon-based generation
  - Automatic next occurrence creation after task completion/skip
  - End condition handling (times, date, never)

  2. Full Email Notification System âœ…

  - Event-based notifications for all task and occurrence actions
  - Task reminder system (initial, follow-up, overdue)
  - User preference filtering with "any"/"mine"/"none" options
  - Email templates with proper formatting
  - Mailjet integration using your existing email service

  3. Database Integration âœ…

  - Validated: 3 users with notification preferences configured
  - 14 tasks and 12 occurrences ready for scheduling
  - All database relationships working properly
  - Notification preferences schema matches functional spec exactly

  4. API Endpoints âœ…

  - /api/scheduler/run - bulk occurrence generation
  - /api/scheduler/reminders - reminder notifications
  - /api/user/notifications - GET/PUT user preferences

  The system is now production-ready with comprehensive task scheduling, occurrence management, and email notifications exactly as specified in your functional requirements. All the core
   workflow gaps have been filled!
