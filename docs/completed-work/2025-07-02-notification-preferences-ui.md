# Notification Preferences UI Implementation
**Date:** January 2, 2025  
**Feature:** User notification preferences management interface  
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Implemented the missing notification preferences UI component that allows users to manage their email notification settings directly from their profile page. This completes the notification system by providing the user-facing interface for preference management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. NotificationPreferences Vue Component
Created a new reusable component at `/components/NotificationPreferences.vue` that:
- Fetches current user notification preferences on mount
- Displays all notification types in two categories:
  - Task Notifications (create, pause, complete, delete)
  - Occurrence Notifications (assign, execute, skip, comment)
- Provides appropriate options for each notification type:
  - Task notifications: "Any task" or "None"
  - Occurrence notifications: "Any occurrence", "My occurrences only", or "None"
- Saves preferences via PUT request to `/api/user/notifications`
- Shows loading states and save confirmation messages
- Handles errors gracefully with user feedback

### 2. Profile Page Integration
Updated `/pages/profile/index.vue` to:
- Replace the placeholder "coming soon" message with the actual NotificationPreferences component
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the profile page

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- **GET /api/user/notifications**: Fetches current preferences
- **PUT /api/user/notifications**: Updates preferences
- Uses `useRequestHeaders(['cookie'])` to ensure authentication

### Type Safety
- Properly typed with `NotificationPreferences` interface from `/types/notification.ts`
- All preference values strongly typed as `'any' | 'mine' | 'none'`

### User Experience
- Loading spinner while fetching preferences
- Disabled save button with "Saving..." text during updates
- Success/error messages that auto-clear after 3 seconds
- Responsive form layout with proper spacing

## Code Structure

```typescript
// Component structure
<template>
  - Loading state
  - Form with two sections:
    - Task Notifications (4 preferences)
    - Occurrence Notifications (4 preferences)
  - Save button with status feedback
</template>

<script setup>
  - Reactive state management
  - API calls for fetch and save
  - Error handling
  - User feedback
</script>
```

## Integration Points

1. **Backend APIs**: Already implemented at:
   - `/server/api/user/notifications.get.ts`
   - `/server/api/user/notifications.put.ts`

2. **Notification Service**: Preferences are checked by:
   - `/server/services/NotificationService.ts`

3. **Database**: Stored in `UserNotificationPreferences` table

## Impact

This implementation completes the notification system loop:
1. ✅ Backend notification sending (already implemented)
2. ✅ User preference storage (already implemented)
3. ✅ **User preference management UI (now implemented)**

Users can now fully control which notifications they receive, making the system production-ready for email notification management.
